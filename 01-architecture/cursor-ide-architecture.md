# Architectural Considerations for Cursor IDE Projects

## Introduction

Cursor IDE's AI capabilities introduce new architectural considerations for project organization. This guide outlines best practices for structuring projects to maximize the effectiveness of Cursor's AI features while maintaining code quality and organization.

## Project Structure Recommendations

### Optimize for AI Understanding

AI agents in Cursor can better understand your codebase with a well-organized structure:

```
project-root/
├── .cursor/          # Cursor-specific configuration
│   └── rules/        # Project rules for AI behavior
├── src/              # Source code
│   ├── components/   # UI components
│   ├── utils/        # Utilities and helpers
│   ├── services/     # API and service integrations
│   └── types/        # Type definitions
├── tests/            # Test files mirroring src structure
├── docs/             # Documentation
└── README.md         # Project overview
```

### Key Principles

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Organize code into logical modules with distinct responsibilities
2. **Consistent Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive, consistent naming patterns for files and directories
3. **Centralized Type Definitions**: Keep types and interfaces in accessible locations for AI context
4. **Documentation Proximity**: Place documentation close to the code it describes
5. **Tests Alongside Code**: Maintain test files that mirror the structure of source code

## AI-Friendly Code Organization

### File Structure Best Practices

1. **Limit File Size**: Smaller, focused files are easier for AI to understand and modify
   - Aim for < 300 lines per file when possible
   - Extract complex functions into separate utilities

2. **Group Related Functionality**: Keep related code in the same directory
   - Feature-based organization works well for AI understanding
   - Consider co-locating tests with implementation files

3. **Clear Import Structure**: Organize imports to reveal dependencies
   - Use index files to simplify imports
   - Consider barrel exports for related components

### Type-Rich Codebase

Strongly-typed codebases provide valuable context for Cursor's AI:

1. **Prefer TypeScript**: Type annotations give the AI crucial understanding
   - Define interfaces for data structures
   - Use specific types rather than generic ones (`string[]` vs `UserName[]`)
   - Include JSDoc comments for JavaScript projects

2. **Central Type Repository**: Maintain a central location for shared types
   - Consider a `types/` directory with domain-specific type files
   - Export types from a central location for easier discovery

3. **Type Documentation**: Add descriptive comments to complex types
   - Explain the purpose and constraints of types
   - Document relationships between different types

## Architectural Patterns for Agent-Based Coding

### Component Architecture

Structure components with clear boundaries that AI can easily understand:

```typescript
// Well-structured component example
export interface ButtonProps {
  label: string;
  onClick: () => void;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
  disabled?: boolean;
}

export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  label,
  onClick,
  variant = 'primary',
  disabled = false
}) => {
  // Implementation
};
```

This structure allows the AI to:
- Understand the component's API through its props interface
- See default values and implementation details
- Make targeted modifications without breaking functionality

### Service Pattern

Isolate external dependencies and API calls in service modules:

```typescript
// API service example
export interface UserService {
  getUser(id: string): Promise<User>;
  updateUser(user: User): Promise<void>;
  // Other methods...
}

export class UserServiceImpl implements UserService {
  private apiClient: ApiClient;
  
  constructor(apiClient: ApiClient) {
    this.apiClient = apiClient;
  }
  
  async getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
    // Implementation
  }
  
  // Other methods...
}
```

This pattern helps Cursor's AI by:
- Defining clear interfaces for services
- Centralizing API interaction logic
- Providing explicit types for request/response handling

### Testing Patterns

Organize tests to support AI-assisted test development:

```typescript
// Test file example
describe('UserService', () => {
  // Setup mocks and test instances
  
  describe('getUser', () => {
    it('returns user data when found', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    it('throws error when user not found', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

This structure enables the AI to:
- Understand testing patterns and expectations
- Generate new tests that follow established patterns
- Update tests when implementation changes

## Configuration for Cursor IDE

### Project Rules Setup

Create effective rules in `.cursor/rules/` to guide AI behavior:

1. **Component Rules**: Define patterns for generating and modifying components
   ```markdown
   # Component Rules
   
   This rule applies to: `src/components/**/*.tsx`
   
   Components should:
   - Use functional component syntax with TypeScript
   - Have a Props interface exported alongside the component
   - Include proper JSDoc documentation
   - Follow the project's design system
   ```

2. **Testing Rules**: Establish consistent testing patterns
   ```markdown
   # Testing Rules
   
   This rule applies to: `**/*.test.ts`, `**/*.test.tsx`
   
   Tests should:
   - Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
   - Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Test both success and failure paths
   ```

3. **API Rules**: Define patterns for API integration
   ```markdown
   # API Rules
   
   This rule applies to: `src/api/**/*.ts`
   
   API code should:
   - Use the service pattern with interfaces
   - Include proper error handling
   - Type all requests and responses
   - Use environment variables for endpoints
   ```

### Notepads for Architecture Documentation

Use Notepads to document key architectural decisions:

1. **Architecture Overview**: High-level description of the system
2. **Component Patterns**: Standard patterns for UI components
3. **State Management**: Approaches for managing application state
4. **API Integration**: Patterns for external service integration

## AI-Assisted Architecture Evolution

### Refactoring Guidance

Provide clear architecture evolution guidelines in your project:

1. **Refactoring Roadmap**: Document planned architectural improvements
2. **Technical Debt Tracking**: Identify areas needing refactoring
3. **Migration Patterns**: Define patterns for code migration

### Collaborative Architecture

Support team collaboration with AI assistance:

1. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Document key decisions
2. **Component Libraries**: Maintain reusable, well-documented components
3. **Shared Prompts**: Develop standard prompts for architectural tasks

## Architecture Diagrams

Include visual representations of your architecture in documentation:

1. **System Context Diagram**: Overall system and external dependencies
2. **Component Diagram**: Major components and their interactions
3. **Data Flow Diagram**: How data moves through the system

## Conclusion

A well-structured architecture significantly enhances the effectiveness of Cursor IDE's AI capabilities. By following these architectural principles, your codebase becomes more accessible to AI agents, leading to higher quality automated assistance and more productive development workflows.

Remember that architecture should evolve with your project, and regular reviews can help identify opportunities to improve AI compatibility as Cursor's capabilities advance.
