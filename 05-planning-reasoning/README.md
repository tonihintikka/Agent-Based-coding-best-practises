# Planning and Reasoning

This section explores how to leverage and enhance the planning and reasoning capabilities of coding agents:

- Decomposing complex tasks into manageable steps
- Structuring planning prompts for optimal results
- Chain-of-thought reasoning techniques
- Verification and self-correction strategies
- Trade-offs between planning time and execution
- Comparative analysis of different reasoning approaches

Effective planning and reasoning are critical for tackling complex development tasks and ensuring that agent-generated code meets requirements and quality standards.
