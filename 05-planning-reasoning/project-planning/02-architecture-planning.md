# Architecture Planning for Agent-Based Coding

## Introduction

Effective architecture planning is crucial for agent-based coding projects. A well-designed architecture enables AI agents to understand your codebase while maintaining engineering quality and standards.

## AI-Friendly Architecture Principles

As the engineer orchestrating AI agents, design your architecture with these principles in mind:

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**:
   - Modular components with single responsibilities
   - Well-defined interfaces between modules
   - Explicit dependencies that AI can understand

2. **Consistent File Organization**:
   - Predictable directory structures
   - Logical grouping of related files
   - Clear naming conventions that reveal purpose

3. **Strong Typing and Documentation**:
   - Type-rich codebase providing context for AI
   - Central repository of shared types
   - Comprehensive JSDoc comments

4. **Test-Driven Development**:
   - Tests that define expected behavior
   - Consistent testing patterns
   - Clear assertions for AI to understand requirements

## Architecture Documentation

Create foundational documentation to guide both team members and AI agents:

1. **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**:
   - Document key architectural decisions and rationales
   - Explain technology choices and trade-offs
   - Provide context for future development

2. **System Context Diagrams**:
   - Visual representation of system boundaries
   - Key external dependencies
   - Data flow between components

3. **Component Interface Definitions**:
   - Clear API specifications for components
   - Expected inputs and outputs
   - Error handling approach

## Sample Architecture Decision Record

# Architecture Decision Record: Agent-Based Testing Strategy

## Context
We need to determine how to effectively leverage AI agents for test generation and execution while ensuring comprehensive coverage and reliability.

## Decision
We will adopt a hybrid approach where:
1. Developers define test specifications with expected behaviors
2. AI agents generate test implementations based on specifications
3. Human developers review and approve generated tests
4. Automated CI validates test quality and coverage

## Rationale
This approach balances the efficiency of AI-generated tests with the critical thinking of human developers. It ensures comprehensive coverage while maintaining quality control.

## Consequences
* Faster test generation for standard scenarios
* Potential for more comprehensive edge case coverage
* Need for clear test specifications
* Additional review step in the development process
```

## Project Structure Recommendations

Create a structure that enables AI comprehension while maintaining engineering best practices:

```
project-root/
├── .cursor/          # Cursor-specific configuration (if using Cursor)
│   └── rules/        # Project rules for AI behavior
├── src/              # Source code with clear organization
├── tests/            # Test files mirroring src structure
├── docs/             # Documentation
│   ├── architecture/ # Architecture documents and diagrams
│   ├── adrs/         # Architecture Decision Records
│   └── api/          # API documentation
└── README.md         # Project overview
```

## Engineer's Orchestration Role

When planning architecture for agent-based coding, the engineer:

1. **Sets the Vision**: Defines the architectural approach and constraints
2. **Establishes Standards**: Creates clear guidelines that AI must follow
3. **Reviews for Quality**: Regularly assesses AI-generated code against architectural standards
4. **Maintains Coherence**: Ensures the architecture remains coherent as AI contributes code

## Next Steps

After defining your architecture:

1. Document architecture decisions and patterns
2. Establish project structure
3. Create initial interface definitions
4. Proceed to [Workflow Design](./03-workflow-design.md)

Remember that the architecture is your responsibility as the engineer. AI agents can help implement within your architectural framework, but the framework itself requires your expertise and judgment.
