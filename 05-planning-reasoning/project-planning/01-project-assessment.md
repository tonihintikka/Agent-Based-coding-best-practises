# Project Assessment for Agent-Based Coding

## Introduction

Assessing project suitability is the first critical step in adopting agent-based coding. This assessment helps you determine whether and how to leverage AI coding agents in your specific context.

## Project Suitability Factors

Evaluate your project against these criteria:

| Favorable Factors | Caution Factors |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Clear requirements with room for implementation flexibility | Extremely rigid specifications with no flexibility |
| Significant boilerplate code and repetitive patterns | Highly specialized or obscure technologies with limited documentation |
| Modular architecture with well-defined interfaces | Deep integration with proprietary systems not well-known to AI |
| Development team open to new workflows | Strong resistance to new development approaches |
| Projects with adequate time for learning and iteration | Urgent projects with no margin for exploration |

## Risk and Compliance Considerations

Identify potential constraints early:

- **Security Requirements**: Determine if your project has specific security concerns about using external AI services
- **Compliance Needs**: Check if regulatory frameworks restrict the use of AI tools (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR)
- **IP Protection**: Assess intellectual property protection requirements and how they impact AI usage
- **Data Sensitivity**: Determine what data can be shared with AI services and what must remain private

## Engineer's Role Assessment

As the orchestrator of AI agents, engineers need to assess their role in the project:

1. **Direction Setting**: Define clear goals, requirements, and quality standards
2. **Critical Decision Points**: Identify where human judgment is essential
3. **Oversight Requirements**: Determine review processes for AI-generated code
4. **Learning Investment**: Budget time for developing effective agent interaction skills

## Outcome-Based Planning

Focus on engineering outcomes rather than AI capabilities:

1. **Desired Engineering Outcomes**: Define what success looks like from a software engineering perspective
2. **Quality Benchmarks**: Establish clear quality standards that must be maintained
3. **Efficiency Targets**: Set realistic goals for productivity improvements
4. **Learning Objectives**: Define what the team should learn about effective AI collaboration

## Next Steps

After completing your assessment:

1. Document your findings in a project charter
2. Identify specific areas where AI agents can provide the most value
3. Outline initial guardrails and boundaries for AI agent usage
4. Proceed to [Architecture Planning](./02-architecture-planning.md)

Remember that the engineer remains the orchestrator throughout this process. AI coding agents are powerful tools, but they require human direction, judgment, and oversight to achieve engineering excellence.
