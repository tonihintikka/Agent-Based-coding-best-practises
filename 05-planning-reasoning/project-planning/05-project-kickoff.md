# Project Kickoff for Agent-Based Coding

## Introduction

A successful project kickoff lays the foundation for effective agent-based coding. This critical phase establishes the tools, processes, and expectations that will guide your project.

## Phased Rollout Strategy

As the engineer orchestrating AI agents, consider a graduated approach to adoption:

1. **Phase 1: Foundation**
   - Basic tool setup and configuration
   - Initial architecture and documentation
   - Core team training

2. **Phase 2: Limited Implementation**
   - Selected components built with AI assistance
   - Controlled testing of autonomous features
   - Workflow refinement based on experience

3. **Phase 3: Full Integration**
   - Comprehensive agent-based workflows
   - Optimized prompts and project rules
   - Advanced autonomous operations (when appropriate)

## Initial Project Setup

Concrete steps to initialize your project:

1. **Repository Setup**:
   - Initialize version control
   - Configure .gitignore for AI artifacts
   - Establish branch protection rules

2. **Development Environment**:
   - Configure AI coding tools for all team members
   - Set up consistent editor settings
   - Install necessary extensions and tools

3. **Documentation Scaffolding**:
   - Create README template
   - Initialize architecture documents
   - Establish documentation standards

## Engineer's Orchestration Tooling

If using Cursor IDE (similar principles apply to other tools):

1. **Project Rules Configuration**:
   ```
   .cursor/rules/
   ├── README.md                    # Overview and usage guidelines
   ├── general-coding-standards.md  # Standards for all code
   ├── component-guidelines.md      # UI component standards
   ├── api-integration.md           # API and service standards
   ├── testing-requirements.md      # Testing approaches and coverage
   └── security-practices.md        # Security-specific requirements
   ```

2. **AI Interaction Guidelines**:
   - Create templates for common prompts
   - Establish context management practices
   - Define review processes for AI-generated code

3. **Workflow Configuration**:
   - Set up project management tools
   - Define task assignment processes
   - Establish communication channels

## Project Kickoff Checklist

```

## Metrics and Evaluation

Define success metrics for agent-based coding:

1. **Productivity Metrics**:
   - Development velocity
   - Time saved on repetitive tasks
   - Feature completion rate

2. **Quality Metrics**:
   - Defect rates in AI-generated code
   - Test coverage and quality
   - Technical debt accumulation

3. **Team Experience Metrics**:
   - Developer satisfaction
   - Learning curve and adoption rate
   - Collaboration effectiveness

## Engineer's Orchestration Role

In project kickoff, the engineer:

1. **Establishes the Foundation**: Creates the structure and processes
2. **Sets Expectations**: Defines success criteria and acceptable practices
3. **Leads by Example**: Demonstrates effective AI collaboration
4. **Monitors Progress**: Tracks adoption and addresses challenges

## Next Steps

After project kickoff:

1. Begin initial development with AI assistance
2. Regularly review and refine processes
3. Document lessons learned and effective patterns
4. Review [Troubleshooting and FAQs](./06-troubleshooting-faqs.md) as needed

Remember that as the engineer, you orchestrate the project kickoff. AI tools assist in implementation, but you define the structure, processes, and standards that will guide the project to success.
