# Security and Quality Planning for Agent-Based Coding

## Introduction

Security and quality assurance are critical aspects of agent-based coding projects. As the engineer orchestrating AI agents, you must establish robust safeguards to ensure that AI-generated code meets security standards and quality requirements.

## Code Review Process

Design a review process that accounts for AI-generated code:

1. **Review Checklist**:
   - Security vulnerability scanning
   - Compliance with project standards
   - Performance considerations
   - Error handling completeness

2. **AI-Assisted Reviews**:
   - Use AI to explain complex segments
   - Generate test cases for edge conditions
   - Identify potential improvements

3. **Engineer's Critical Role**:
   - Final security judgment
   - Verification of compliance with standards
   - Authorization of production-ready code

## Testing Strategy

Develop a comprehensive testing approach:

1. **Test Coverage Goals**:
   - Set clear coverage targets by module
   - Prioritize critical path testing
   - Establish acceptance criteria

2. **AI-Generated Tests**:
   - Guidelines for generating test cases
   - Validation process for AI tests
   - Integration with test frameworks

3. **Engineer Verification**:
   - Review of test coverage and quality
   - Identification of missing edge cases
   - Final approval of test suite

## Security Measures

Implement specific security controls for agent-based coding:

1. **Code Generation Guardrails**:
   - Restricted API access
   - Secure dependency management
   - Sensitive data handling protocols

2. **Vulnerability Prevention**:
   - Security-focused code reviews
   - Automated scanning of generated code
   - Regular security training

3. **Agent Restrictions**:
   - Limited access to sensitive systems
   - Controlled execution environments
   - Monitoring of agent activities

## Security Checklist for AI-Generated Code

```markdown
# AI-Generated Code Security Checklist

## Input Validation
- [ ] All user inputs are properly validated
- [ ] Input validation occurs before processing
- [ ] Input size limits are enforced

## Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Proper authentication mechanisms are implemented
- [ ] Authorization checks are in place
- [ ] Principle of least privilege is followed

## Data Protection
- [ ] Sensitive data is properly encrypted
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Proper handling of PII

## Error Handling
- [ ] Errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Error messages don't reveal sensitive information
- [ ] Proper logging without sensitive data

## Dependencies
- [ ] All dependencies are from trusted sources
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date without known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Minimum necessary permissions for dependencies
```

## Quality Assurance Mechanisms

Establish processes to maintain code quality:

1. **Automated Quality Checks**:
   - Static analysis tool integration
   - Code linting and formatting
   - Complexity metrics monitoring

2. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Benchmarking of AI-generated code
   - Resource utilization tracking
   - Optimization guidelines

3. **Documentation Standards**:
   - Required documentation elements
   - Clarity and completeness criteria
   - Maintenance requirements

## Engineer's Orchestration Role

In security and quality planning, the engineer:

1. **Sets Standards**: Defines security requirements and quality benchmarks
2. **Creates Safeguards**: Establishes processes to catch and prevent issues
3. **Makes Final Judgments**: Provides ultimate approval on security and quality matters
4. **Monitors Effectiveness**: Continuously assesses and improves security measures

## Sample Security Rules Configuration

If using Cursor IDE, establish project rules for security:

```markdown
# Security Standards

This rule applies to: `**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}`

All code must:
- Sanitize all input data before processing
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper error handling without leaking sensitive information
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Include security-focused tests for all new functionality
```

## Next Steps

After establishing security and quality plans:

1. Implement security scanning tools
2. Create quality assurance processes
3. Develop security training for team members
4. Proceed to [Project Kickoff](./05-project-kickoff.md)

Remember that security and quality are your responsibility as the engineer. While AI agents can help identify and fix issues, you must establish the standards and verify that all code—regardless of its origin—meets your requirements.
