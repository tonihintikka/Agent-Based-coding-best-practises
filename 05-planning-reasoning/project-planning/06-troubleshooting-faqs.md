# Troubleshooting and FAQs for Agent-Based Coding

## Common Challenges and Solutions

As an engineer orchestrating AI agents, you may encounter these challenges:

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| AI generates inconsistent code | Improve project rules specificity; standardize prompt templates |
| Team members use AI differently | Establish clear guidelines; share effective prompt patterns |
| Security concerns with autonomous features | Implement stricter allow/deny lists; increase review frequency |
| Poor quality AI-generated code | Enhance context provided to AI; refine architecture documentation |
| Slow AI response times | Consider model size trade-offs; optimize prompt length |
| AI suggests outdated practices | Provide current documentation; explicitly specify modern approaches |
| Context limitations with large codebases | Use strategic file references; create abstraction summaries |

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Engineering Orchestration

**Q: How do we balance human and AI contributions to maintain engineering skills?**  
A: As the orchestrator, assign complex logic, critical decisions, and architectural work to engineers while delegating repetitive implementation, boilerplate, and routine testing to AI. Rotate engineers through different roles to maintain breadth of skills. Always have engineers review and understand AI-generated code.

**Q: How can we ensure engineering quality when using autonomous coding features?**  
A: Implement strict quality gates including comprehensive code reviews, automated testing, and security scanning for all AI-generated code. Set clear acceptance criteria before tasks begin. Consider restricting autonomous features to non-critical parts of your codebase.

**Q: What's the learning curve for engineers new to orchestrating AI coding agents?**  
A: Typically 2-4 weeks for basic proficiency, with continued improvement over 2-3 months. Engineers familiar with pair programming adapt more quickly. Focus first on clear prompting, effective review processes, and understanding model limitations.

### Technical Challenges

**Q: How do we handle intellectual property concerns with AI-generated code?**  
A: Consult legal counsel regarding your specific situation. Generally, establish clear documentation of AI involvement, maintain human review and modification of generated code, and avoid sharing sensitive proprietary algorithms with AI systems.

**Q: How do we integrate AI-generated code with our existing CI/CD pipelines?**  
A: Apply the same quality gates to all code regardless of origin. Consider adding AI-specific checks like prompt injection analysis and additional security scanning. Document AI contributions in commit messages for traceability.

**Q: How should we handle situations where AI generates technically correct but poorly optimized code?**  
A: Create explicit performance requirements in your prompts. Develop optimization-specific project rules. Implement performance testing in CI/CD pipelines. Use the "optimizing feedback loop" technique: have the AI review and optimize its own output before human review.

### Process Questions

**Q: How do we measure ROI for adopting agent-based coding?**  
A: Track metrics like development velocity, time saved on repetitive tasks, defect rates, and developer satisfaction. Compare these to baseline measurements from traditional development approaches to quantify benefits.

**Q: How often should we update our project rules and guidelines?**  
A: Review and update after each project phase or milestone, incorporating lessons learned. Additionally, schedule quarterly reviews to incorporate new best practices and tool capabilities.

**Q: How do we address resistance to AI adoption within development teams?**  
A: Start with low-risk, high-value use cases that demonstrate clear benefits. Provide structured training and mentorship. Emphasize that AI is a tool to handle routine work, freeing engineers for more creative and complex tasks. Celebrate early wins and share success stories.

## Troubleshooting Decision Tree

Use this decision tree when facing challenges with AI-generated code:

```
Is the issue with AI-generated code?
├── Quality Problem
│   ├── Incorrect logic → Improve prompt specificity and examples
│   ├── Poor performance → Add explicit performance requirements
│   ├── Security issue → Enhance security rules and scanning
│   └── Maintainability → Refine architecture documentation
├── Process Problem
│   ├── Slow iteration → Optimize prompt templates and context
│   ├── Inconsistent usage → Standardize team practices
│   ├── Overreliance → Rebalance human/AI responsibilities
│   └── Underutilization → Identify additional use cases
└── Tool Problem
    ├── Model limitations → Evaluate alternative models
    ├── Context issues → Improve context management
    ├── Integration problems → Review tool configurations
    └── Performance → Optimize resource allocation
```

## Engineer's Orchestration Role in Troubleshooting

When troubleshooting AI agent issues:

1. **Diagnose Systematically**: Identify whether the issue is with prompting, context, model limitations, or process
2. **Adjust Parameters**: Modify prompts, context, or tool configurations to address issues
3. **Establish Guardrails**: Create additional safeguards where recurring problems emerge
4. **Document Solutions**: Share effective solutions with the team to prevent similar issues

## Resources for Continued Learning

As you continue to develop your agent orchestration skills:

1. **Official Documentation**:
   - Tool-specific guidance (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
   - Model documentation for capabilities and limitations

2. **Community Resources**:
   - User forums for your specific AI coding tools
   - Engineering blogs about agent-based coding experiences

3. **Internal Knowledge Base**:
   - Create a repository of effective patterns and solutions
   - Document case studies from your own projects

Remember that as the orchestrating engineer, your judgment and expertise remain central to resolving issues with AI coding agents. The AI is your tool - you determine how to use it effectively and when to apply alternative approaches.
