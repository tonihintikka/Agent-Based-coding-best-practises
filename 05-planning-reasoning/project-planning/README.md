# Agent-Based Coding: Project Planning Guide

## Introduction

This guide outlines best practices for the crucial planning phase of agent-based coding projects. Effective planning is essential for maximizing the benefits of AI coding agents while mitigating potential risks and challenges. Throughout this guide, we emphasize that **the engineer remains the orchestrator of the AI agents** - AI tools are powerful assistants, but the engineer provides the vision, direction, and critical judgment.

## Key Principles

Throughout your planning process, keep these core principles in mind:

1. **Engineer as Orchestrator**: The human engineer directs and oversees the AI agents, making critical decisions about architecture, approach, and quality.

2. **Clear Boundaries**: Establish where AI assistance is most valuable and where human expertise is essential.

3. **Iterative Refinement**: Plan for continuous improvement of your agent-based workflows based on experience.

4. **Quality Verification**: Always verify and validate AI-generated outputs according to your engineering standards.

5. **Knowledge Transfer**: Document effective patterns to build team capabilities over time.

These sections provide a comprehensive framework for planning agent-based coding projects that balance AI capabilities with human expertise.
