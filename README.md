# 🧠 Best Practices for Agent-Based Coding

Welcome! This repository brings together **best practices, tools, and examples** for **agent-based coding** – a rapidly evolving paradigm where intelligent agents assist or autonomously handle software development tasks. The goal is to provide a **clear, practical guide** for leveraging AI agents effectively and securely in real-world projects, whether you're a solo developer, part of a team, or working in an enterprise environment.

## 🔍 Why Agent-Based Coding?
In 2025, **agent-based programming** is transforming how we build software. Intelligent coding agents understand context, plan, write, and even test code, accelerating development, improving code quality, and enabling innovative workflows. Harnessing this power requires **a solid foundation of best practices and tool knowledge** – and that's exactly what this repository offers.
