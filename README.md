# 🧠 Best Practices for Agent-Based Coding

Welcome! This repository brings together **best practices, tools, and examples** for **agent-based coding** – a rapidly evolving paradigm where intelligent agents assist or autonomously handle software development tasks. The goal is to provide a **clear, practical guide** for leveraging AI agents effectively and securely in real-world projects, whether you're a solo developer, part of a team, or working in an enterprise environment.

## 🔍 Why Agent-Based Coding?
In 2025, **agent-based programming** is transforming how we build software. Intelligent coding agents understand context, plan, write, and even test code, accelerating development, improving code quality, and enabling innovative workflows. Harnessing this power requires **a solid foundation of best practices and tool knowledge** – and that’s exactly what this repository offers.

## 🎯 What's Inside?
- ✅ **Best practices** for agent-driven development: code quality, architecture, and security
- ⚙️ **Tools and libraries**: e.g., Cursor, Continue, Codeium, Auto-GPT, LangChain Agents
- 🔐 **Security insights**: managing risks like prompt injection, uncontrolled agent actions, data leaks
- 📚 **Use cases and examples**: applying agents in web, backend, data, DevOps, and more
- 🔄 **CI/CD and observability integration**: connecting agents to your workflows

## 🚀 Purpose
This is a **living resource**, updated regularly to keep up with rapid developments in agent-based programming. The aim is to build a **community-driven knowledge base and reference hub** for developers navigating this new era of software development.
