- **@folder/**: Include an entire folder
- **@symbol**: Reference a specific code symbol (function, class, etc.)
- **@docs**: Reference documentation
- **@web**: Access information from the internet
- **@notepad**: Reference saved context from Notepads

Example usage in the Composer:

```
@utils/helpers.js I need to refactor this function to be more efficient:
@components/Button.jsx Please update this component to use the refactored helper.
```

### Context Best Practices

1. **Be Selective**: Include only relevant files to prevent context overload
2. **Use Open Editors**: The `/Reference Open Editors` command adds all currently open files to context
3. **Prioritize Type Definitions**: Include type definitions and interfaces for better understanding
4. **Add Documentation**: Reference relevant documentation to guide the AI
5. **Use Notepads for Reusable Context**: Store frequently used context in Notepads

## YOLO Mode

YOLO (You Only Live Once) mode is a powerful feature that enables autonomous execution of terminal commands.

### Capabilities

- Automatically executes terminal commands without explicit approval
- Enables continuous workflows like writing and testing code
- Automates repetitive tasks across multiple files
- Facilitates test-driven development through automated iteration

### Configuration

1. **Enable YOLO Mode**:
   - Access through Settings → Composer → YOLO Mode
   - Enable the feature (disabled by default)

2. **Safety Configuration**:
   - **Allow List**: Commands explicitly permitted (e.g., `npm test`, `npm run lint`)
   - **Deny List**: Commands explicitly forbidden (e.g., `rm -rf`, `git push`)
   - **YOLO Prompt**: Define the scope and boundaries of autonomous operation

### Safe Usage Guidelines

1. **Always Use Privacy Mode** when handling sensitive code
2. **Populate the Deny List** with potentially harmful commands:
   - `git commit` (prevents unauthorized commits)
   - `deploy`, `publish` (prevents production deployments)
   - `rm -rf` and variants (prevents destructive file operations)
   - Database modification commands

3. **Start with Limited Autonomy**:
   - Begin with well-defined, smaller tasks
   - Gradually expand as you gain confidence
   - Always monitor activity, especially initially

4. **Use for Test-Driven Development**:
   - Instruct the AI to write tests first
   - Have it implement code to pass tests
   - Let it iterate until all tests pass

### Example Use Cases

1. **Code Refactoring**: Applying consistent changes across multiple files
2. **Test Suite Expansion**: Adding new test cases and ensuring code passes them
3. **Dependency Updates**: Updating and fixing compatibility issues
4. **Boilerplate Generation**: Creating standard project structures and files

## Notepads for Context Management

Notepads serve as versatile context-sharing tools that bridge the gap between the Composer and Chat interfaces.

### Key Features

- Store reusable contexts for various development tasks
- Extend beyond traditional configuration files
- Support file attachments for comprehensive context
- Function as dynamic templates for code generation

### Creating and Using Notepads

1. **Creation**: Click "+" in the Notepads section

## Project Rules System

The Project Rules system allows fine-grained control over AI behavior in different parts of your project.

### Key Concepts

- **Storage**: Rules are stored as markdown files in the `.cursor/rules/` directory
- **Pattern Matching**: Uses glob patterns to apply rules to specific files
- **Context Inclusion**: References other files using `@file` syntax
- **Automatic Application**: Rules apply when matching files are referenced

### Creating Effective Rules

1. **Access**: Use Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P) → "New Cursor Rule"
2. **Structure**: Include clear descriptions of when rules apply
3. **Specificity**: Use glob patterns to target specific file types or paths
4. **Context**: Include relevant context with `@file` references
5. **Chaining**: Create hierarchical rules through references

### Migration from .cursorrules

The older `.cursorrules` file in the project root is being phased out in favor of Project Rules:

| Feature | .cursorrules | Project Rules (.cursor/rules/) |
|---------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Granularity | Project-wide | File/folder specific |
| Pattern Matching | Limited | Glob patterns |
| Referencing | Not supported | @file syntax |
| Creation | Manual | Command palette |
| Future Support | Deprecated | Recommended |
