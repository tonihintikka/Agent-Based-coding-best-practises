# Providing Reference Documentation to Cursor IDE

## Introduction

One of the most powerful but underutilized features of Cursor IDE is its ability to index and understand reference documentation, framework guides, and best practice documents. By providing these resources to Cursor, you can significantly improve the quality and relevance of AI-generated code, ensuring it follows preferred patterns, standards, and the latest best practices for your chosen frameworks.

This guide explains how to effectively provide reference documentation to Cursor and how to leverage this capability in your development workflow.

## Why Provide Reference Documentation?

When Cursor can index official documentation, framework guides, or design systems, you get several benefits:

1. **Framework-Accurate Code**: Generated code will better follow the recommended patterns and practices of your chosen frameworks
2. **Consistent Design Implementation**: UI code will adhere to your selected design system's principles
3. **Current Best Practices**: Code will reflect up-to-date approaches rather than potentially outdated patterns
4. **Reduced Corrections**: Less time spent fixing generated code that doesn't align with your preferred approach
5. **Better Architecture Alignment**: Code that better integrates with your project's architectural decisions

## Types of Reference Documentation to Provide

### Framework Documentation

- Next.js documentation
- React best practices
- Vue.js style guide
- Angular architecture guides
- Express.js patterns

### Design Systems

- Material Design guidelines
- Tailwind best practices
- Bootstrap implementation guides
- Company-specific design systems
- Shadcn/UI component documentation

### Coding Standards

- TypeScript style guides
- ESLint configuration explanations
- Team-specific coding standards
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Performance optimization guides

### API Documentation

- REST API specifications
- GraphQL schema documentation
- Third-party API integration guides
- Authentication patterns
- Data validation approaches

## Methods for Providing Documentation to Cursor

Cursor provides several methods for including reference documentation in its context. Choose the approach that works best for your specific needs:

### 1. Direct File References with @ Symbol

For documentation you have locally:

```
@docs/material-design-guidelines.md
@docs/nextjs-patterns.md

I need to create a dashboard page following our design system and Next.js best practices.
```

This approach works best for:
- Documentation you've saved locally
- Team-specific standards and guides
- Project-specific architectural decisions

### 2. Notepads for Framework Guidelines

Create dedicated Notepads with key framework guidelines:

1. Create a new Notepad (e.g., "Next.js Best Practices")
2. Copy relevant sections from official documentation
3. Organize into clear sections with headers
4. Reference in your prompts:

```
@notepad Next.js-Best-Practices

Please create a data fetching component following our Next.js standards.
```

This approach works best for:
- Frequently referenced guidelines
- Condensed versions of larger documentation
- Curated selections of best practices

### 3. Project Rules with Documentation Links

In your `.cursor/rules/` directory, create rules that reference documentation:

```markdown
# Next.js App Router Guidelines

This rule applies to: `app/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`

Follow the Next.js App Router documentation: https://nextjs.org/docs

Key patterns to follow:
- Use Server Components by default
- Client Components should be leaf components when possible
- Follow the loading/error UI patterns
- Implement proper data fetching with fetch and revalidation
```

This approach works best for:
- Enforcing standards across specific file patterns
- Documentation that applies to particular project areas
- Combining rules with documentation references

### 4. Web References for Official Documentation

For official online documentation:

```
@web https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching

Based on the latest Next.js data fetching patterns, please implement...
```

This approach works best for:
- Official online documentation
- Recently updated resources
- Documentation that changes frequently

## Best Practices for Documentation Indexing

### 1. Be Selective and Focused

**Do:**
- Choose the most relevant sections of documentation
- Focus on parts that directly apply to your current project
- Prioritize official sources and well-maintained guides

**Don't:**
- Overwhelm Cursor with entire documentation sites
- Include outdated or deprecated guidelines
- Mix conflicting standards from different sources

### 2. Organize Documentation Logically

**Do:**
- Create separate Notepads for different frameworks/topics
- Use clear headers and structure within documentation
- Label documentation clearly with version information

**Don't:**
- Mix multiple frameworks in a single reference
- Provide documentation without proper organization
- Forget to update documentation as frameworks evolve

### 3. Reference Documentation Strategically

**Do:**
- Reference relevant documentation at the start of related tasks
- Combine general framework guides with specific patterns
- Include both "what to do" and "what to avoid"

**Don't:**
- Reference the same documentation in every prompt
- Include documentation irrelevant to the current task
- Assume Cursor remembers documentation from previous sessions

### 4. Maintain Documentation Currency

**Do:**
- Regularly update local copies of documentation
- Note documentation versions where applicable
- Review and refine your documentation collection

**Don't:**
- Rely on outdated framework guidelines
- Ignore major framework version changes
- Mix guidelines from incompatible versions

## Real-World Examples

### Material Design Implementation

```
@notepad Material-Design-Principles
@web https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/guidelines

I need to create a primary button component following Material Design 3 guidelines. It should have regular, hover, focus, and disabled states. Please implement this using React and Tailwind CSS.
```

### Next.js App Router Implementation

```
@docs/nextjs-app-router-guide.md
@notepad Our-API-Patterns

I'm creating a product listing page that needs to fetch data from our API. It should implement proper loading states, error handling, and pagination following the Next.js App Router patterns described in the documentation.
```

### Company Coding Standards

```
@notepad Company-TypeScript-Standards
@notepad React-Component-Patterns

Please refactor this component to follow our company's TypeScript standards and React component patterns. It should use proper typing, follow our naming conventions, and implement the recommended error handling approach.
```

## Case Study: Framework-Guided Development

A development team working on a large e-commerce platform implemented the following documentation strategy with Cursor:

1. **Documentation Setup**:
   - Created Notepads for key Next.js patterns (data fetching, routing, optimization)
   - Saved Material Design component guidelines locally
   - Established Project Rules linking to official documentation
   - Developed team-specific standards based on framework best practices

2. **Reference Strategy**:
   - Referenced framework documentation at the start of feature development
   - Included specific component guidelines when implementing UI elements
   - Added team standards for consistent implementation
   - Updated documentation references with each major framework version

3. **Results**:
   - 35% reduction in framework-related bugs
   - More consistent implementation across the codebase
   - Faster onboarding of new team members
   - Better alignment with official framework recommendations

## Troubleshooting Documentation References

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Documentation isn't influencing generated code** | Ensure documentation is properly referenced; try more explicit instructions pointing to specific parts |
| **Cursor seems to ignore specific guidelines** | Break down guidelines into smaller, clearer points; provide specific examples |
| **Generated code follows outdated patterns** | Update documentation references; explicitly mention current version requirements |
| **Documentation context seems lost** | Re-reference documentation in new prompts; check if context was cleared |
| **Conflicting recommendations in code** | Check for contradictory guidelines; establish clear priority order |
