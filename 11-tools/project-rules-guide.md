# Effective Project Rules for Cursor IDE

## Introduction

Project Rules in Cursor IDE provide powerful control over AI behavior, enabling consistent, project-specific responses tailored to your codebase. This guide explores how to create, organize, and leverage Project Rules to maximize the effectiveness of agent-based coding.

## Understanding Project Rules

Project Rules are Markdown files stored in the `.cursor/rules/` directory that customize how Cursor's AI behaves when working with your code. Unlike the legacy `.cursorrules` file, Project Rules offer more granular control through pattern matching and context chaining.

### Key Capabilities

- **Pattern-Specific Behavior**: Apply different rules to different file types or paths
- **Rich Semantic Descriptions**: Provide detailed guidance on when and how rules apply
- **Automatic Inclusion**: Rules activate when matching files are referenced
- **Context References**: Include other files as additional context using `@file` syntax
- **Rule Chaining**: Create hierarchical rules through references

## Creating Your First Project Rule

### Setup Process

1. **Create the Rules Directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .cursor/rules
   ```

2. **Create a New Rule**:
   - Via Command Palette: `Cmd + Shift + P` > `New Cursor Rule`
   - Or manually create a Markdown file in `.cursor/rules/`

3. **Basic Rule Structure**:
   ```markdown
   # Component Standards
   
   This rule applies to: `src/components/**/*.tsx`
   
   Components should:
   - Use functional component syntax with TypeScript
   - Include Props interface with JSDoc comments
   - Follow atomic design principles
   - Implement proper error handling
   ```

### File Pattern Syntax

Project Rules use glob patterns to target specific files:

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `*` | Matches any characters in a single path segment | `*.tsx` |
| `**` | Matches any characters across multiple path segments | `src/**/*.js` |
| `?` | Matches a single character | `file?.js` |
| `[...]` | Matches characters in brackets | `file[123].js` |
| `{...}` | Matches any pattern in braces | `file.{js,ts}` |

## Practical Rule Examples

### Style and Formatting Rules

```markdown
# Code Style Standards

This rule applies to: `src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`

All code should follow these standards:
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for components and classes
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons at the end of statements
- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Use template literals instead of string concatenation
```

### Component Development Rules

```markdown
# React Component Standards

This rule applies to: `src/components/**/*.tsx`

React components should:
- Be functional components using React.FC type
- Have a Props interface exported alongside component
- Have comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Follow atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- Implement error boundaries for fault tolerance
- Use CSS modules for styling
- Be tested with component tests

Example component structure:
```typescript
interface ButtonProps {
  /** Text content of the button */
  label: string;
  /** Function called when button is clicked */
  onClick: () => void;
  /** Visual variant of the button */
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'tertiary';
  /** Whether the button is disabled */
  disabled?: boolean;
}

/**
 * Button component following design system guidelines
 * @example
 * <Button label="Submit" onClick={handleSubmit} variant="primary" />
 */
export const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  label,
  onClick,
  variant = 'primary',
  disabled = false
}) => {
  // Implementation
};
```
```

### API Integration Rules

```markdown
# API Service Standards

This rule applies to: `src/services/**/*.ts`

API services should:
- Use the repository pattern
- Implement proper error handling with custom error classes
- Include retry logic for transient failures
- Add appropriate logging
- Use strongly typed request/response interfaces
- Include timeout handling
- Document all methods with JSDoc

Reference the API error handling utilities:
@file src/utils/api-errors.ts
```

### Testing Standards

```markdown
# Testing Standards

This rule applies to: `src/**/*.test.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`

Tests should:
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Have descriptive test names explaining expected behavior
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Avoid testing implementation details
- Use test data factories for consistent test data

Example test structure:
```typescript
describe('UserService', () => {
  // Setup
  
  describe('getUser', () => {
    it('returns user data when user exists', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const userId = '123';
      mockApi.get.mockResolvedValueOnce({ data: { id: userId, name: 'Test User' } });
      
      // Act
      const result = await userService.getUser(userId);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toEqual({ id: userId, name: 'Test User' });
    });
    
    it('throws NotFoundError when user does not exist', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const userId = '456';
      mockApi.get.mockRejectedValueOnce({ response: { status: 404 } });
      
      // Act & Assert
      await expect(userService.getUser(userId)).rejects.toThrow(NotFoundError);
    });
  });
});
```
```

## Advanced Rule Techniques

### 1. Rule Chaining with File References

Chain rules together by referencing other files for expanded context:

```markdown
# Form Component Standards

This rule applies to: `src/components/forms/**/*.tsx`

All form components should follow the component standards:
@file .cursor/rules/component-standards.md

Additionally, form components should:
- Use Formik or React Hook Form for form state management
- Implement comprehensive validation using Yup or Zod
- Include proper accessibility attributes
- Handle form submission errors gracefully

Reference the form utilities:
@file src/utils/form-utils.ts
```

### 2. Including External Documentation

Enhance rules with external documentation references:

```markdown
# GraphQL Standards

This rule applies to: `src/graphql/**/*.{ts,tsx}`

GraphQL implementations should follow Apollo Client best practices:
@web https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/operation-best-practices/

All queries should:
- Be colocated with the components that use them
- Include only necessary fields to minimize response size
- Implement proper type generation using GraphQL Codegen
- Handle loading, error, and success states
```

### 3. Environment-Specific Rules

Create rules that adapt to different environments:

```markdown
# Environment Configuration

This rule applies to: `src/config/**/*.ts`

Configuration should:
- Use environment variables with strong typing
- Include validation for required variables
- Provide sensible defaults for development
- Never hardcode sensitive information
- Use different strategies for development vs production:

Development:
- Load from .env.development file
- Include detailed logging
- Use mock services when appropriate

Production:
- Validate all required variables at startup
- Implement secrets rotation
- Minimize logging of sensitive data
```

## Rule Organization Strategies

### Project-Wide Rules

Create base rules that apply to the entire project:

- `code-style.md`: General coding conventions
- `documentation.md`: Documentation requirements
- `security.md`: Security best practices
- `error-handling.md`: Exception handling patterns

### Domain-Specific Rules

Organize rules by domain or feature:

- `authentication/`: Rules for auth components and services
- `payments/`: Rules for payment processing code
- `admin/`: Rules for admin interfaces

### Technology-Specific Rules

Create rules for different technologies used in your stack:

- `react-components.md`: React component standards
- `node-services.md`: Node.js service patterns
- `database-access.md`: Database interaction patterns

## Integrating Rules into Team Workflows

### Version Control Integration

1. **Store Rules in Repository**:
   - Commit rules to version control
   - Document rule purpose and scope in the rule itself
   - Include examples where appropriate

2. **Review Process**:
   - Review rule changes like code changes
   - Consider implications for existing code
   - Ensure alignment with team standards

3. **Change Management**:
   - Communicate rule changes to the team
   - Consider migration strategies for existing code
   - Use major version bumps for significant changes

### Team Adoption

1. **Onboarding Process**:
   - Include rule review in developer onboarding
   - Provide examples of rule application
   - Explain the reasoning behind key rules

2. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Regularly review and refine rules
   - Solicit feedback from team members
   - Update rules as project evolves

3. **Enforcement Strategy**:
   - Decide on automated vs. manual enforcement
   - Consider integrating with CI/CD processes
   - Balance strictness with developer autonomy

## Migrating from .cursorrules

If you're currently using the older `.cursorrules` file, here's how to migrate to the Project Rules system:

1. **Assess Current Rules**:
   - Review your existing `.cursorrules` file
   - Identify patterns and constraints

2. **Create Targeted Rule Files**:
   - Split general rules into more specific, targeted rules
   - Use glob patterns to apply rules to appropriate files

3. **Enhance with New Features**:
   - Add file references for additional context
   - Include more detailed descriptions
   - Implement rule chaining

4. **Validate Results**:
   - Test rules with various prompts
   - Ensure AI behavior aligns with expectations
   - Refine as needed

Example migration:

**Before** (`.cursorrules`):
```
The codebase uses TypeScript and React.
Components follow atomic design principles.
Services should implement repository pattern.
Always add unit tests for new code.
```

**After** (Project Rules):
```markdown
# General Standards
This rule applies to: `src/**/*`

The codebase uses TypeScript and React. Always add unit tests for new code.

# Component Standards
This rule applies to: `src/components/**/*.tsx`

Components follow atomic design principles with atoms, molecules, and organisms.
@file src/components/atoms/Button.tsx
@file src/components/molecules/Card.tsx

# Service Standards
This rule applies to: `src/services/**/*.ts`

Services should implement repository pattern with proper error handling.
@file src/services/UserService.ts
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Rules Not Being Applied

**Issue**: Your rules don't seem to influence the AI's behavior.

**Solutions**:
- Verify the rule file path is correct in `.cursor/rules/`
- Check the glob pattern matches the files you're working with
- Ensure the rule content is clear and specific
- Try explicitly referencing the rule with `@file .cursor/rules/your-rule.md`

### Conflicting Rules

**Issue**: Different rules provide contradictory guidance.

**Solutions**:
- Create a hierarchy of rules with clear precedence
- Use more specific glob patterns to target the right files
- Refactor rules to eliminate contradictions
- Use rule chaining to establish clear relationships

### Performance Issues

**Issue**: Too many rules slow down AI responses.

**Solutions**:
- Consolidate related rules
- Make rules more concise and focused
- Use more specific glob patterns
- Remove unnecessary file references

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Be Specific**: Create targeted rules for different file types and components
2. **Include Examples**: Provide concrete examples of desired patterns
3. **Use Clear Language**: Write rules in plain, unambiguous terms
4. **Organize Hierarchically**: Create a logical structure of general and specific rules
5. **Version Control**: Treat rules as code with proper review and management
6. **Keep Updated**: Regularly review and refine rules as the project evolves
7. **Balance Detail**: Include enough guidance without overwhelming specificity
8. **Document Purpose**: Explain the reasoning behind rules for team understanding
