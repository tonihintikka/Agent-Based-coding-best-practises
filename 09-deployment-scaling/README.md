# Deployment and Scaling

This section explores strategies for deploying and scaling agent-based coding systems in enterprise environments:

- Integrating agents into CI/CD pipelines
- Team-wide adoption strategies
- Infrastructure requirements for scaled deployment
- Performance optimization for large codebases
- Multi-user agent environments
- Governance models for agent-based workflows
- Metrics and monitoring for agent usage
- Cost management and optimization

Effective deployment and scaling approaches ensure that agent-based coding delivers consistent value across growing development teams and complex projects.
