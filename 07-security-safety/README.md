# Security and Safety

This section addresses critical security and safety considerations for agent-based coding:

- Secure handling of code generation and modification
- Preventing prompt injection vulnerabilities
- Managing access to sensitive codebases
- Secure credential handling by AI agents
- Secure deployment of agent-generated code
- Regulatory compliance considerations
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Protecting against exploits in agent-based workflows

Security must remain a priority when integrating AI agents into development workflows, especially for production code and sensitive applications.
