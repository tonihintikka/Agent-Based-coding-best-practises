# Security and Safety

This section addresses critical security and safety considerations for agent-based coding:

- Secure handling of code generation and modification
- Preventing prompt injection vulnerabilities
- Managing access to sensitive codebases
- Secure credential handling by AI agents
- [Secure deployment of agent-generated code](agent-secure-deployment.md)
- [Web application production security checklist](web-application-production-checklist.md)
- Regulatory compliance considerations
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Protecting against exploits in agent-based workflows

Security must remain a priority when integrating AI agents into development workflows, especially for production code and sensitive applications.

## Available Guides

- [Secure Deployment of Agent-Generated Code](./agent-secure-deployment.md) - Best practices for securely deploying AI-generated code
- [Web Application Production Security Checklist](./web-application-production-checklist.md) - Comprehensive security checklist for web applications

## Coming Soon

This section is being expanded with additional security guides. Planned content includes:

- **Prompt Injection Prevention**: Techniques to prevent malicious prompt injection attacks
- **Secure Credential Management**: Safe handling of secrets and credentials with AI agents
- **Regulatory Compliance Guide**: Meeting compliance requirements while using AI coding agents
- **Risk Assessment Framework**: Methodically evaluating security risks in agent-based coding
