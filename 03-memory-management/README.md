# Memory Management

This section explores strategies for effective memory and context management in agent-based coding:

- Short-term vs. long-term memory patterns
- Context handling and optimization
- Preventing context overload and loss
- Structuring memory for efficient retrieval
- State persistence across sessions
- Memory augmentation techniques (e.g., vector databases, knowledge graphs)

Effective memory management is crucial for maintaining agent coherence and ensuring high-quality code generation across complex projects.
