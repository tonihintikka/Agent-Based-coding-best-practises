# Memory Management

This section explores strategies for effective memory and context management in agent-based coding:

- Short-term vs. long-term memory patterns
- Context handling and optimization
- Preventing context overload and loss
- Structuring memory for efficient retrieval
- State persistence across sessions
- Memory augmentation techniques (e.g., vector databases, knowledge graphs)

Effective memory management is crucial for maintaining agent coherence and ensuring high-quality code generation across complex projects.

## Coming Soon

This section is currently under development. Planned content includes:

- **Context Optimization Guide**: Techniques for providing effective context to AI coding agents
- **Memory Persistence Patterns**: Methods for maintaining state across coding sessions
- **Token Management Strategies**: Working within context limitations of AI models
- **External Knowledge Integration**: Using vector databases and other tools to extend agent memory

Check back soon for updates, or consider contributing to this section!
