# Testing and Evaluation

This section covers approaches for testing and evaluating agent-generated code and agent performance:

- AI-assisted test generation and execution
- Evaluation frameworks for code quality
- Reliability assessment of agent outputs
- Comparative benchmarking methodologies
- Integration testing with agent-generated components
- Performance metrics for agent-based coding
- Continuous evaluation in development workflows

Robust testing and evaluation ensure that agent-generated code meets quality standards and performs as expected in production environments.

## Coming Soon

This section is currently under development. Planned content includes:

- **Test Generation Guide**: Using AI agents to create comprehensive test suites
- **Code Quality Evaluation**: Frameworks for assessing the quality of agent-generated code
- **Reliability Testing Patterns**: Strategies for verifying the consistency of agent outputs
- **Continuous Evaluation**: Integrating agent assessment into CI/CD pipelines

Check back soon for updates, or consider contributing to this section!
