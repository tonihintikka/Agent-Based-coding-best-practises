# Testing and Evaluation

This section covers approaches for testing and evaluating agent-generated code and agent performance:

- AI-assisted test generation and execution
- Evaluation frameworks for code quality
- Reliability assessment of agent outputs
- Comparative benchmarking methodologies
- Integration testing with agent-generated components
- Performance metrics for agent-based coding
- Continuous evaluation in development workflows

Robust testing and evaluation ensure that agent-generated code meets quality standards and performs as expected in production environments.
