# Key Terms in Agent-Based Coding

This glossary defines important terms and concepts related to agent-based coding, providing clarity and context for developers exploring this rapidly evolving paradigm.

## Core Concepts

### Agent-Based Coding
A software development approach where AI agents with varying levels of autonomy assist or perform coding tasks, ranging from suggesting completions to independently writing and modifying code.

### AI Agent
An autonomous or semi-autonomous AI system capable of perceiving its environment, making decisions, and taking actions to achieve specific goals. In coding contexts, these agents can generate, modify, test, and debug code.

### Large Language Model (LLM)
An advanced AI model trained on vast text datasets that can understand and generate human-like text. LLMs form the foundation of most coding agents, enabling them to understand programming languages and generate appropriate code.

### Context Window
The amount of text (tokens) an AI model can consider at once when generating responses. Larger context windows allow the AI to "see" more code and documentation simultaneously, improving its understanding of complex codebases.

### Prompt Engineering
The practice of crafting effective instructions for AI systems to achieve desired outcomes. In agent-based coding, this involves creating clear, specific directions that guide the AI in generating appropriate code.

## Cursor IDE Terms

### Cursor IDE
An AI-enhanced code editor built on Visual Studio Code, featuring advanced AI capabilities including code generation, refactoring, and automated task execution.

### Chat Interface
Cursor's interface for asking questions about code or requesting changes to a single file, activated with Ctrl+L/Cmd+L. Focused on smaller, localized tasks and explanations.

### Composer
Cursor's advanced interface for complex, multi-file coding tasks, accessed via Ctrl+I/Cmd+I. Enables more detailed instructions and context for larger development tasks.

### Agent Mode
A feature within Cursor's Composer that enables the AI to work more autonomously, making decisions about how to implement requested changes across multiple files.

### YOLO Mode
"You Only Live Once" mode in Cursor that allows the AI agent to autonomously execute terminal commands without requiring explicit approval for each step, significantly streamlining development workflows.

### Notepads
A feature in Cursor that serves as a context-sharing tool, allowing developers to create, manage, and reference reusable contexts for various development tasks.

### Project Rules
Markdown files stored in the .cursor/rules/ directory that customize AI behavior through patterns and instructions, enabling fine-grained control over the AI's actions in different parts of a project.

### @ Symbol
A reference mechanism in Cursor that allows developers to include files, code symbols, documentation, and Notepads in the AI's context, enhancing its understanding of the project.

## Security and Best Practices

### Prompt Injection
A security vulnerability where malicious inputs manipulate an AI agent into performing unintended actions, similar to SQL injection for databases.

### Allow/Deny Lists
Configuration settings in Cursor's YOLO mode that specify which terminal commands the AI agent is permitted to run (allow list) or forbidden from executing (deny list).

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
A browser security feature that helps protect against content injection attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by specifying which dynamic resources are allowed to load.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
A security approach that restricts system access based on users' roles within an organization, often implemented to secure agent-generated code in production.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Agents
A development methodology where AI agents write tests before implementing features, then iteratively improve code until tests pass, ensuring functionality and quality.

## Related Technologies

### GitHub Copilot
An AI pair programming tool developed by GitHub and OpenAI that suggests code completions and entire functions within various code editors.

### Continue
An open-source AI coding assistant that focuses on code editing, generation, and chat capabilities within IDEs like VS Code and JetBrains products.

### Codeium
A free AI coding assistant that offers code completions, natural language search, and code explanations across multiple editors and languages.

### OpenAI Agents SDK
A toolkit for building sophisticated autonomous AI systems with features like built-in agent loops, function tools, and mechanisms for handoffs between specialized agents.

### Aider
A command-line tool that uses GPT-4 to help developers code by editing multiple files and integrating with git repositories.

### DevOps Agents
AI agents specifically designed to assist with infrastructure code, deployment processes, and operational tasks in the software development lifecycle.

## Terms Related to Implementation

### Embeddings
Vector representations of code and natural language that enable AI systems to understand semantic relationships and similarities between different pieces of code.

### Fine-Tuning
The process of further training an LLM on specialized datasets (like code repositories) to improve its performance on specific tasks like code generation.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
A technique that enhances AI outputs by retrieving relevant information from external sources (like documentation or codebase) before generating responses.

### Multi-Agent Systems
Software systems where multiple AI agents with different specializations collaborate to solve complex problems, often with different agents handling distinct aspects of development.

### Agent Orchestration
The coordination and management of multiple AI agents working together, including handling communication between agents and managing the flow of tasks.

### Tool Use
The ability of AI agents to use external tools and APIs to extend their capabilities beyond text generation, such as running code, accessing databases, or interacting with version control systems.
