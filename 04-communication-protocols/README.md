# Communication Protocols

This section covers communication patterns and protocols for agent-based coding systems:

- Developer-to-agent communication best practices
- Inter-agent communication in multi-agent systems
- Structured prompt engineering for coding tasks
- Communication standardization for team environments
- Feedback loops and iterative refinement
- Documentation and commenting conventions

Establishing clear, effective communication protocols is essential for maximizing the value of AI agents in the development process.

## Coming Soon

This section is currently under development. Planned content includes:

- **Prompt Engineering for Code**: Specialized techniques for code-related prompts
- **Multi-Agent Communication Patterns**: Protocols for systems with multiple specialized agents
- **Standardized Team Communication**: Establishing consistent communication practices across development teams
- **Feedback Loop Design**: Creating effective iterative improvement cycles

Check back soon for updates, or consider contributing to this section!
