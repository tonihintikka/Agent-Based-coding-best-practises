# Communication Protocols

This section covers communication patterns and protocols for agent-based coding systems:

- Developer-to-agent communication best practices
- Inter-agent communication in multi-agent systems
- Structured prompt engineering for coding tasks
- Communication standardization for team environments
- Feedback loops and iterative refinement
- Documentation and commenting conventions

Establishing clear, effective communication protocols is essential for maximizing the value of AI agents in the development process.
