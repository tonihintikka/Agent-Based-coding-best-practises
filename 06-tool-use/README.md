# Tool Use

This section covers how coding agents can effectively use and integrate with external tools:

- Tool selection and configuration strategies
- Safe usage of autonomous tooling (YOLO mode)
- Terminal command integration and execution
- API consumption patterns
- Version control system integration
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) integration
- Custom tool development for agent augmentation

Effective tool use significantly extends agent capabilities, enabling more complex workflows and improving overall development efficiency.
