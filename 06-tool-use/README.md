# Tool Use

This section covers how coding agents can effectively use and integrate with external tools:

- Tool selection and configuration strategies
- Safe usage of autonomous tooling (YOLO mode)
- Terminal command integration and execution
- API consumption patterns
- Version control system integration
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) integration
- Custom tool development for agent augmentation

Effective tool use significantly extends agent capabilities, enabling more complex workflows and improving overall development efficiency.

## Available Guides

- [YOLO Mode Best Practices](./yolo-mode-best-practices.md) - Safe usage of Cursor's autonomous mode

## Coming Soon

This section is being expanded with additional guides on tool usage. Planned content includes:

- **Terminal Command Safety**: Guidelines for safe command execution by AI agents
- **Version Control Integration**: Best practices for AI integration with Git and other VCS
- **IDE Integration Patterns**: Optimizing the connection between AI agents and development environments
- **API Integration Guide**: Techniques for AI agents to securely consume external APIs
